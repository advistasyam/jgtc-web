    line1: "Formed in 2015, ICM Production stands for I Create Music Production, a community originating from West Jakarta. ICM itself was founded by Qebrelt and was formed because its personnel have the same hobby, namely playing online games; in addition, ICM production wants to create a music community with the same vision, values, and high solidarity. Currently, the group consists of David Josade (Pianist), Ezekiel Dave (Drums), Qebrelt (Guitar), Vincent Nathanael (Bass), and Bernadi Dickyto (Keyboard).",
    line2: "This special performance session consisted of iconic songs such as ‘How High the Moon', a jazz standard with lyrics by Nancy Hamilton and music by Morgan Lewis. It was first featured in the 1940 Broadway Revue. Written as a slow ballad, its complex and interesting chord progressions make the song a bebop favorite and is now almost always performed up-tempo.",
